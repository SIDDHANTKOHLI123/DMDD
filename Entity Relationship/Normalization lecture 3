 Functional dependency is when you have one value you get other value . example in : employee enitity has 2 keys employee id and employee name , having employee id gives us employee name so employee name is functionally dependent on employee id. Functional dependency helps us to choose priamry key.
    employee id ---> employee name(employee id determines employee name , this shows functional dependency)
